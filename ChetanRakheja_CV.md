## Senior SDET | AI Agent Workflows | MCP • Python • LLM Infrastructure

**6+ Years | Distributed Systems | API Engineering | Backend Validation | Exploring AI Engineering**

I'm a Senior SDET with 6.6+ years of experience in distributed systems, API engineering, and backend validation for enterprise-scale applications. Over the past year I've been going deep into AI engineering — designing and integrating custom MCP-compatible tooling, building LLM-powered workflows, and shipping production AI projects independently.

My QA background gives me something most AI engineers don't naturally have — a systematic instinct for evaluation, edge cases, and failure modes. When I look at an LLM-powered system, I think about where it breaks, how to measure it, and how to make it reliable.

## Professional Experience

### Iris Software Pvt. Ltd. — Gurugram, India
**Senior Software Development Engineer in Test** (Client: **National Australia Bank - NAB**) | Jul 2025 – Present

- Designed and integrated custom MCP-compatible tooling enabling LLM agents to perform multi-step workflows — API execution, database state verification, test case generation from technical documents, and artifact extraction — within an enterprise banking engineering environment.
- Used agentic AI for root cause analysis — navigating complex enterprise codebases to surface bug locations and error context for developers, accelerating defect resolution.
- Generated test cases autonomously from technical specification documents using LLM-based workflows, reducing manual test design effort significantly.
- Built and embedded AI-generated blackbox tests directly in the development repository, enabling shift-left quality detection at commit time.
- Validated Airflow DAG pipelines — verified Parquet file ingestion, data transformation logic, and downstream output to Kafka topics and databases.
- Built Avro-based contract-testing framework validating microservice integrations and backward compatibility.
- Automated Kafka schema and event verification, reducing integration failures across distributed services.
- Delivered Java (Gradle) backend automation suites integrated into CI pipelines for early defect detection.
- Implemented SQL-driven backend verification to reduce manual validation effort and improve data accuracy.
- Optimized pipelines for faster, parallelized automation runs and steadier releases.
